This is the README file to the pet_projects_spark_connect. 
For a deep dive into connecting Apache Spark to a local machine, I would like to thank the practice on Youtube - from the channel Datalearn.

The practice was conducted in conjunction with the material prepared by Oleg Agapov on interacting with Apache Spark.

I take great pride in the industry when I see projects like this, able to share a wealth of information with other professionals in the field and novice professionals. 

The repository stores an ipynb file of the project made in Jupyter on the local machine. The file also contains a basic ETL-pipeline for dataframe conversion. The dataframe is also included in the repository.
